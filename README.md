## Analyze A/B Test Results

Introduction
------------
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to help the company understand if they should:
- Implement this new page, 
- Keep the old page, or 
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
------------
It is believed that the secret to getting value from data is testing, and if oneâ€™s looking to grow her online business, implementing well-executed, consistent A/B testing is a necessity. This means that we know more about our customers, statistically, than anyone else in our market, which is one of our most important competitive advantages.

------------
The original datasets are available here for your quick download. You can also get access to my notebook Analyze A/B Test Results.ipynb to review the actual code. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions in the introduction. Markdown cells will assist in walking through the thought process for each step.

Within the framework of this project, three main statistical methods are used:

- Probability
- Hypothesis testing
- Regression models
